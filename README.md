# SchoolApp-
This is a school app Python Program which is beneficial for students and the school employees. It shows their personal details and also they can write letters to respected authorities.
I have just created a sample APP looking python program.
There could be more features to it like displaying student's assignments, and wishing birthdays to the students as soon as they login,etc .
You can give some more ideas to me if you have.

#Details 

1. I have added some letters in a binary format in order display the uses of binary reading in my program file.
2. There is a database where I have stored all the tables related to the school. There are such 12 tables in it.

# Steps for Opening The Project

1. import the python program in your computer
2. Copy all the binary files in the same folder where you have imported the python program
3. import the database in my SQL workbench
4. Then run the program, if any such error comes related to connectivity or database imports then please handle it on your own.
5. If an error comes related to connectivity, then check out the arguments of the connection function in the program and set the arguments accordingly.

 I hope I have explained well for opening the project files.
